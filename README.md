# Algo-Supply-Chain-
SMART SOLUTION TEAM GROUP 9 
This will be our project repository for this Hackathon.
Make sure every changes made should be committed to a new branch with details.
This repo, we will have to initialize Algokit init from this main repo and select both front end and backend template.


*Creating a digital identity on the blockchain for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to receive aid from NGOs.*

Here’s a structured approach for us to implementing this solution:

*Define Requirements**
   - **Stakeholders:** Identify the key stakeholders (IDPs, NGOs, government bodies, etc.).
   - **Data Points:** Determine the necessary information for the digital identity (e.g., name, age, location, needs).

*Choose a Blockchain Platform**
 Algorand

*Identity Creation Process**
   - **User Registration:**
     - Develop a secure application where IDPs can register their identities using their personal information.
     - Use biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition) for enhanced security if feasible.

   - **Data Encryption:**
     - Encrypt sensitive data before storing it on the blockchain to protect user privacy.
     - Consider using decentralized storage solutions (like IPFS) for large data files while keeping references on-chain.
 *Smart Contract Development**
   - **Identity Smart Contract:**
     - Create a smart contract that manages identity creation, storage, and verification.
     - Include functions for registering a new identity, updating identity information, and verifying identities.

*Integration with NGOs**
   - **Verification Mechanism:**
     - Develop a mechanism for NGOs to verify the identities of IDPs before providing aid.
     - Use the smart contract to check the validity of the IDP’s digital identity.

  *Aid Distribution:**
     - Design smart contracts to manage the distribution of aid, ensuring only verified IDPs receive assistance.
     - Track aid distribution on the blockchain for transparency.

**User Interface Development**
   - Build a user-friendly interface for IDPs to manage their digital identities.
   - Create a dashboard for NGOs to view and manage aid distribution.


**Community Engagement and Training**
   - Engage with IDPs to educate them about using digital identities.
   - Provide training for NGOs on how to use the system effectively.

*Summary*
By following these steps, you can create a secure and efficient digital identity solution on the blockchain for IDPs to receive aid from NGOs, enhancing transparency and trust in the aid distribution process.
